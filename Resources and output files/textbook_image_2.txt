These examples illustrate processing results intended for human interpretation.
The second major area of application of digital image processing techniques men-
tioned at the beginning of this chapter is in solving problems dealing with machine
perception. In this case, interest is on procedures for extracting information from
an image, in a form suitable for computer processing. Often, this information bears
little resemblance to visual features that humans use in interpreting the content
of an image. Examples of the type of information used in machine perception are
statistical moments, Fourier transform coefficients, and multidimensional distance
measures. Typical problems in machine perception that routinely utilize image pro-
cessing techniques are automatic character recognition, industrial machine vision
for product assembly and inspection, military recognizance, automatic processing of
fingerprints, screening of X-rays and blood samples, and machine processing of aer-
ial and satellite imagery for weather prediction and environmental assessment. The
continuing decline in the ratio of computer price to performance, and the expansion
of networking and communication bandwidth via the internet, have created unprec-
edented opportunities for continued growth of digital image processing. Some of
these application areas will be illustrated in the following section.
