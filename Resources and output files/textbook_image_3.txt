The term spatial domain refers to the image plane itself, and image processing methods in this category
are based on direct manipulation of pixels in an image. This is in contrast to image processing in a trans-
form domain which, as we will discuss in Chapters 4 and 6, involves first transforming an image into the
transform domain, doing the processing there, and obtaining the inverse transform to bring the results
back into the spatial domain. Two principal categories of spatial processing are intensity transforma-
tions and spatial filtering. Intensity transformations operate on single pixels of an image for tasks such
as contrast manipulation and image thresholding. Spatial filtering performs operations on the neighbor-
hood of every pixel in an image. Examples of spatial filtering include image smoothing and sharpening.
In the sections that follow, we discuss a number of “classical” techniques for intensity transformations
and spatial filtering.
