This edition of Digital Image Processing is a major revision of the book. As in
the 1977 and 1987 editions by Gonzalez and Wintz, and the 1992, 2002, and 2008
editions by Gonzalez and Woods, this sixth-generation edition was prepared
with students and instructors in mind. The principal objectives of the book
continue to be to provide an introduction to basic concepts and methodologies
applicable to digital image processing, and to develop a foundation that can
be used as the basis for further study and research in this field. To achieve
these objectives, we focused again on material that we believe is fundamental
and whose scope of application is not limited to the solution of specialized
problems. The mathematical complexity of the book remains at a level well
within the grasp of college seniors and first-year graduate students who have
introductory preparation in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability,
statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. The book website pro-
vides tutorials to support readers needing a review of this background material.
One of the principal reasons this book has been the world leader in its field for
40 years is the level of attention we pay to the changing educational needs of our
readers. The present edition is based on an extensive survey that involved faculty,
students, and independent readers of the book in 150 institutions from 30 countries.
The survey revealed a need for coverage of new material that has matured since the
last edition of the book. The principal findings of the survey indicated a need for:
